# BioinformHer Module 2 Mini Project

## 📌 Project Title
**Evolutionary Conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Across Species**

BioinformHer Cohort – Module 2

## 🧠 Project Objective
To investigate the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across six different species using bioinformatics tools. This includes sequence retrieval, pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, sequence logo generation, and phylogenetic tree construction.

## 🛠 Tools and Platforms Used
- **NCBI BLAST** – Sequence retrieval and similarity search  
- **EMBOSS Needle** – Pairwise sequence alignment  
- **Clustal Omega / MUSCLE** – Multiple sequence alignment  
- **Skylign** – Sequence logo generation  
- **MEGA X** – Phylogenetic tree construction  

## 📂 Files Included
- `HBB_MiniProject_YourFullName.pdf` – Final project report  

## 📝 Report Summary
This mini-project showcases how the HBB gene is conserved across species. Results confirm that humans and chimpanzees have the closest evolutionary relationship based on HBB sequence similarity. The phylogenetic tree and sequence logo highlight conserved regions likely essential for hemoglobin function.
